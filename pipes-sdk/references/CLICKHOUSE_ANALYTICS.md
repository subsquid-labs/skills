# ClickHouse Analytics Query Patterns

Query patterns for building real-time dashboards on top of ClickHouse tables populated by Pipes SDK indexers. Covers time bucketing, conditional aggregation, parameterized queries, and performance.

## CollapsingMergeTree Basics

Pipes SDK uses `CollapsingMergeTree(sign)` for reorg handling. **Every analytics query must filter `sign = 1`** to exclude cancelled rows:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM hl_fills WHERE sign = 1
-- Without: may count rows that were rolled back
```

This is the most common bug in dashboard queries. Always include it.

## Time Bucketing

`toStartOfInterval` is the workhorse for time-series charts:

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 1 HOUR) AS t,
  sum(volume) AS volume
FROM my_table
WHERE sign = 1
GROUP BY t
ORDER BY t
```

### Interval Mapping

Map user-facing interval labels to SQL:

```typescript
const INTERVAL_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
  '5m':  '5 MINUTE',
  '15m': '15 MINUTE',
  '30m': '30 MINUTE',
  '1h':  '1 HOUR',
  '4h':  '4 HOUR',
  '1d':  '1 DAY',
}

function mapInterval(interval?: string): string {
  return INTERVAL_MAP[interval || '1h'] || '1 HOUR'
}
```

### Window Mapping (Time Range Filter)

Map user-facing window labels to SQL time ranges:

```typescript
const WINDOW_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
  '1h':  '1 HOUR',
  '6h':  '6 HOUR',
  '24h': '24 HOUR',
  '7d':  '7 DAY',
  '30d': '30 DAY',
}

// In WHERE clause:
// timestamp > now() - INTERVAL ${WINDOW_MAP[window]}
```

**Special case: `all`** — omit the time filter entirely to query the full dataset.

## Parameterized WHERE Clause Builder

Build safe, composable WHERE clauses:

```typescript
interface QueryParams {
  interval?: string
  coin?: string
  window?: string
}

function buildWhereClause(params: QueryParams, extraConditions: string[] = []): string {
  const conditions = ['sign = 1']

  if (params.window !== 'all') {
    const windowSql = WINDOW_MAP[params.window || '24h'] || '24 HOUR'
    conditions.push(`timestamp > now() - INTERVAL ${windowSql}`)
  }

  if (params.coin) {
    conditions.push(`coin = '${params.coin.replace(/'/g, '')}'`)
  }

  conditions.push(...extraConditions)
  return conditions.join(' AND ')
}
```

Usage:

```typescript
const where = buildWhereClause(params, ['crossed = 1'])
const sql = `SELECT ... FROM hl_fills WHERE ${where} GROUP BY t ORDER BY t`
```

## Conditional Aggregation with sumIf / countIf

ClickHouse's `*If` combinators are powerful for computing multiple metrics in a single pass:

```sql
-- Volume split by side
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 1 HOUR) AS t,
  sumIf(notional, side = 'Buy') AS buy_volume,
  sumIf(notional, side = 'Sell') AS sell_volume,
  sumIf(notional, side = 'Buy') - sumIf(notional, side = 'Sell') AS delta
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1 AND crossed = 1
GROUP BY t
ORDER BY t
```

```sql
-- Fee breakdown
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 1 HOUR) AS t,
  sumIf(fee, crossed = 1) AS taker_fees,
  sumIf(fee, crossed = 0) AS maker_fees,
  sum(fee) AS total_fees
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1
GROUP BY t
ORDER BY t
```

```sql
-- Stats summary
SELECT
  count() AS fill_count,
  sum(notional) AS total_volume,
  sumIf(notional, crossed = 1) AS taker_volume,
  round(sumIf(notional, crossed = 1) / sum(notional) * 100, 2) AS taker_pct,
  sum(fee) AS total_fees,
  countIf(closed_pnl < -1000
    AND dir IN ('Close Long', 'Close Short')
    AND start_position != 0
    AND abs(closed_pnl) > notional * 0.1
  ) AS liquidation_count
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1
```

## Common Analytics Queries

### Top N by Volume

```sql
SELECT
  coin,
  sum(notional) AS volume,
  count() AS fills
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1 AND timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY coin
ORDER BY volume DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Large Fills Detection

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 1 HOUR) AS t,
  coin,
  count() AS large_fills,
  sum(notional) AS large_volume,
  max(notional) AS max_fill
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1 AND notional > 100000
GROUP BY t, coin
ORDER BY t, large_volume DESC
```

### Liquidation Heuristic

Hyperliquid doesn't flag liquidations explicitly. This heuristic detects them:

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp, user, coin, dir, px, sz, notional, closed_pnl, fee
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1
  AND closed_pnl < -1000
  AND dir IN ('Close Long', 'Close Short')
  AND start_position != 0
  AND abs(closed_pnl) > notional * 0.1
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100
```

Logic:
- `closed_pnl < -1000` — significant loss
- `dir IN ('Close Long', 'Close Short')` — position being closed
- `start_position != 0` — had an open position
- `abs(closed_pnl) > notional * 0.1` — loss is >10% of trade size (not just fees)

### Liquidation Timeline (Aggregated)

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 1 HOUR) AS t,
  count() AS liquidations,
  sum(notional) AS liquidation_volume,
  sum(abs(closed_pnl)) AS total_loss
FROM hl_fills
WHERE sign = 1
  AND closed_pnl < -1000
  AND dir IN ('Close Long', 'Close Short')
  AND start_position != 0
  AND abs(closed_pnl) > notional * 0.1
GROUP BY t
ORDER BY t
```

## Query Execution Wrapper

Wrap all queries with timing metadata:

```typescript
async function query<T>(sql: string): Promise<{
  data: T[]
  meta: { query_ms: number; rows: number }
}> {
  const start = performance.now()
  const result = await client.query({ query: sql, format: 'JSONEachRow' })
  const data = await result.json<T>()
  const query_ms = Math.round(performance.now() - start)
  return { data, meta: { query_ms, rows: data.length } }
}
```

This lets the frontend display query performance and row counts — useful for debugging and user confidence.

## ClickHouse Client Setup

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@clickhouse/client'

const client = createClient({
  url: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_URL || 'http://localhost:8123',
  database: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_DB || 'my_dashboard',
  password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD || 'default',
  clickhouse_settings: {
    date_time_output_format: 'iso',  // returns ISO strings, not Unix timestamps
  },
})
```

**`date_time_output_format: 'iso'`** is critical — without it, DateTime64 columns return platform-dependent formats that are hard to parse consistently in JavaScript.

## Performance Tips

### Partitioning

For tables with >100M rows, partition by month:

```sql
CREATE TABLE hl_fills (
  ...
) ENGINE = CollapsingMergeTree(sign)
ORDER BY (coin, block_number, user, dir)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(timestamp)
```

Benefits:
- Queries with time filters skip irrelevant partitions entirely
- `timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR` only reads the current month's partition
- Dropping old data is instant: `ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION 202501`

### LowCardinality

Use `LowCardinality(String)` for columns with limited distinct values:

```sql
coin LowCardinality(String),     -- ~200 distinct values
side LowCardinality(String),     -- 2 values: Buy, Sell
dir LowCardinality(String),      -- ~7 values
user LowCardinality(String),     -- thousands, but still benefits
fee_token LowCardinality(String) -- ~5 values
```

Typically 2-5x compression improvement and faster GROUP BY.

### ORDER BY Matters

The `ORDER BY` in the table definition determines the primary index. Put the most-filtered column first:

```sql
-- Good: coin is almost always in WHERE clause
ORDER BY (coin, block_number, user, dir)

-- Bad: block_number first means coin filters scan everything
ORDER BY (block_number, coin, user, dir)
```

### Query-Level Optimizations

```sql
-- Use FINAL to force merge of CollapsingMergeTree rows (slower but accurate)
SELECT ... FROM hl_fills FINAL WHERE ...

-- Or filter sign = 1 (faster, works if inserts are correct)
SELECT ... FROM hl_fills WHERE sign = 1 AND ...

-- Prefer sign = 1 for dashboards — FINAL is expensive on large tables
```

```sql
-- Limit GROUP BY cardinality
-- Bad: GROUP BY t, coin, user (millions of groups)
-- Good: GROUP BY t, coin (thousands of groups)
-- Best: GROUP BY t (one group per time bucket)
```

## API Server Pattern

Minimal Bun server with route-to-query mapping:

```typescript
const routes: Record<string, (params: QueryParams) => Promise<any>> = {
  '/api/stats': getStats,
  '/api/volume': getVolume,
  '/api/fees': getFeeAnalysis,
}

Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  async fetch(req) {
    const url = new URL(req.url)
    const handler = routes[url.pathname]
    if (handler) {
      const params = {
        interval: url.searchParams.get('interval') || undefined,
        coin: url.searchParams.get('coin') || undefined,
        window: url.searchParams.get('window') || undefined,
      }
      const result = await handler(params)
      return Response.json(result, {
        headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' },
      })
    }
    // ... static file serving
  },
})
```

**Always include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`** for local development — the frontend may be served from a different port.
