# Troubleshooting: Error Patterns

For database commands and configuration, use [CREDENTIALS.md](CREDENTIALS.md): inject secrets through the environment or protected client files, and never print them or pass their values as command arguments.

Reference for diagnosing and fixing runtime errors in Pipes SDK indexers. Match the user's error to a pattern and follow the diagnostic + fix steps.

## Diagnostic Workflow

1. **Read the error message** — get exact text
2. **Match to a pattern below** — most common issues are catalogued
3. **Read context** — `src/index.ts`, `package.json`, non-secret configuration, redacted stack trace
4. **Verify environment** — database running, Node version, dependencies installed
5. **Apply fix** — edit files or run commands
6. **Restart and verify** — confirm logs show expected behavior
7. **Validate data** — run [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) checks before declaring success

## Error Pattern 1: ABI Version Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
```
Type 'LogParams' is not assignable to type 'EvmLogParams'
Property 'topics' is missing in type 'LogParams'
```

**Root cause:** `@subsquid/evm-abi` v1.x.x instead of v0.3.1.

**Fix:**
```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@subsquid/evm-abi": "^0.3.1"
  }
}
```
Then `npm install` and verify types resolve.

## Error Pattern 2: Portal API Connection Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED
Error: Portal request failed with status 429
{"error":{"type":"rate_limit_error","code":"overloaded","message":"..."}}
Error: Portal timeout after 30s
```

**First, know what the SDK already does:** the Pipes SDK retries retryable Portal failures **indefinitely by default** — connection errors (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `terminated`), HTTP timeouts, and 429/502/503/504/52x responses — honoring the `Retry-After` header when present, otherwise backing off on a schedule (10ms → 20s). A transient blip does not kill the pipe; sustained failures show up as a stalled sync with retry warnings in the log.

Portal returns **structured errors** (`{"error": {"type", "code", ...}}`): `rate_limit_error`/`overloaded` (429/529, always carries `Retry-After`) and `availability_error` (`no_workers`, `retries_exhausted`, `upstream_unavailable`; 502/503) are retried by the SDK. `invalid_request_error` (`malformed_request`, `unknown_dataset`) is **not retryable** — the request itself is wrong.

**Fix options:**
- **Persistent 429/529 `overloaded`** — Portal is at capacity: reduce concurrent indexers (especially Solana), or wait
- **`unknown_dataset` (404)** — wrong dataset name in the portal URL; verify with `curl -I https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/{name}/metadata`
- **ECONNREFUSED that never recovers** — check internet, verify Portal URL
- **Timeout loops** — reduce batch size / block range

```typescript
// Smaller range reduces load
range: { from: 21_000_000, to: 21_100_000 }
```

## Error Pattern 3: Database Connection Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED localhost:5432
Error: ClickHouse authentication failed
Error: Database 'pipes' does not exist
```

**Fix:**
1. Check database is running: `docker ps | grep clickhouse` (or postgres)
2. Verify the configured endpoint and authentication without displaying the connection secret
3. Start if needed: `docker start clickhouse` or `docker-compose up -d`
4. Create database if missing:
   ```bash
   docker exec clickhouse clickhouse-client --query "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS pipes"
   ```

**BigQuery sink:** failures look nothing like this — there is no local process and no connection string. Credentials come from Google application-default credentials, and the dataset must already exist (the target creates tables, never datasets). Configuration failures surface as `E2201`–`E2213` codes; see [BIGQUERY_TARGET.md](BIGQUERY_TARGET.md).

### Harmless: `Unknown table 'pipes.sync'` on First Run

On a brand-new indexer, the SDK tries to read the sync table for resume state, fails (it doesn't exist yet), then creates it. **Ignore this error on first run.**

## Error Pattern 4: Event Decoding Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Cannot decode event with signature '0x...'
TypeError: Cannot read property 'from' of undefined
```

**Fix:**
1. Verify ABI import in `src/index.ts`
2. Check contract address is correct
3. Confirm event ABI matches the signature:
   ```typescript
   events: { swap: uniswapV3.events.Swap }  // not commonAbis.erc20.events.Transfer
   ```
4. For custom contracts, regenerate ABI:
   ```bash
   # First save and validate the local ABI following ABI_GUIDE.md
   npx @subsquid/evm-typegen@4.6.0 src/contracts ./abi/contract.json
   ```

## Error Pattern 4b: Proxy Contract ABI — Crash on Startup

**Symptoms:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'topic')
    at evmEventDecoder (evm-decoder.ts:...)   // "at evmDecoder" on alpha-era installs
```

**Diagnosis:** CLI/typegen fetched the proxy ABI (only `Upgraded` event), but `index.ts` references events like `Supply`, `Borrow`, etc. that only exist on the implementation.

**Confirm:**
```bash
grep "export const events" src/contracts/*.ts
# Only "Upgraded" = proxy
```

**Fix:**
1. Find implementation address on Etherscan → "Read as Proxy" tab
2. Save and validate `abi/implementation.json` following [ABI_GUIDE.md](ABI_GUIDE.md), then regenerate types:
   ```bash
   # First save and validate the local ABI following ABI_GUIDE.md
   npx @subsquid/evm-typegen@4.6.0 src/contracts ./abi/implementation.json
   ```
3. Update import in `src/index.ts` to the implementation file
4. **Keep the proxy address** in `contracts:` — events emit from the proxy

See [ABI_GUIDE.md](ABI_GUIDE.md) for the full proxy handling guide, including non-standard patterns (Aragon, Diamond).

## Error Pattern 5: Missing Data

**Symptoms:** Indexer runs but database is empty or partial.

**Fix checklist:**
1. **Start block is before events occurred** — verify deployment block on Etherscan
2. **Contract is not a proxy** — check Error Pattern 4b
3. **Event names match ABI exactly** — case-sensitive
4. **Filter logic is not over-restrictive**
5. **Sync table conflict** — if another indexer used this database, yours may resume from the wrong block:
   ```bash
   docker exec <container> clickhouse-client \
     --query "SELECT * FROM <database>.sync FORMAT Vertical"
   ```
   Fix: use a separate database per indexer. If sharing is deliberate, confirm the pipe id and delete only that cursor row; never drop a shared `sync` table.

## Error Pattern 5b: Factory Indexer Shows Zero Data

**Symptoms:** Factory-pattern indexer syncs blocks but DB has 0 rows for 30–60+ seconds.

**Diagnosis:** The factory pattern only discovers child contracts from `range.from` forward. If no new children were created in the synced range, there's no data yet.

**This is expected, not a bug.**

**Fix:**
- Wait 60–90 seconds
- To track ALL historical children, set `range.from` to the factory's deployment block
- Verify contracts are being discovered: `ls -la <project>/*.sqlite` (size > 0)

## Error Pattern 5c: Timestamps Show 1970 Dates

**Symptoms:** All dates in ClickHouse show as `1970-01-28`, `1970-01-21`, or similar.

**Diagnosis:** The JS value's precision doesn't match the column's — and this fails in **both** directions, so "1970" alone doesn't tell you which way. Check the column type first:
```bash
docker exec clickhouse clickhouse-client \
  --query "DESCRIBE TABLE <db>.<table>" | grep timestamp
```
ClickHouse parses `DateTime(3)` as `DateTime64(3)` (millisecond precision). A **seconds** value in that column lands in 1970 just as badly as a **milliseconds** value in a plain `DateTime` (verified: `1782669669` → `1970-01-21`).

**Fix:** Match the JS value to the column precision:

| Column type | Precision | Correct JS value |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| `DateTime` | seconds | `Math.floor(d.timestamp.getTime() / 1000)` |
| `DateTime(3)` / `DateTime64(3)` | milliseconds | `d.timestamp.getTime()` (do **not** divide) |

CLI-generated tables use `timestamp DateTime(3)`, so the scaffold's transformers correctly emit undivided `getTime()` — do **not** "fix" them by dividing. The `enrichEvents` helper (custom templates only) emits seconds, matching a plain `DateTime` column.

**Recovery:** Drop tables + sync, delete SQLite (if factory), restart.

## Error Pattern 6: Memory Issues

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: JavaScript heap out of memory
Process killed (signal 9)
```

**Fix options:**
1. Reduce block range
2. Reduce tracked contracts
3. Process smaller batches
4. Raise Node memory limit:
   ```bash
   NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run dev
   ```

## Error Pattern 7: ClickHouse Schema Issues

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Table already exists
Error: Column type mismatch
Error: Cannot insert NULL into NOT NULL column
```

**Fix:**
1. Drop and recreate:
   ```bash
   docker exec clickhouse clickhouse-client \
     --query "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pipes.table_name"
   ```
2. Verify schema matches data types (addresses = String, amounts = Float64, block numbers = UInt64, timestamps = DateTime(3))
3. Clear the affected pipe's data and confirmed cursor row for a fresh start:
   ```bash
   docker exec clickhouse clickhouse-client \
     --query "ALTER TABLE pipes.sync DELETE WHERE id = '<confirmed-pipe-id>' SETTINGS mutations_sync=1"
   ```

## Error Pattern 8: Process Crashed / Indexer Died Mid-Sync

**Symptoms:** Process exited, `npm run dev` was killed, partial data in database.

**Diagnosis:** Normal crash recovery. The sync table tracks progress.

**Fix:**
1. Restart — it resumes automatically:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Verify `Resuming from X` log line shows a block near where it crashed
3. If data looks corrupted, drop sync + data tables and start fresh

## Error Pattern 9: Node.js Version Compatibility Issues

**Symptoms:**
```
ZSTD_error_prefix_unknown
TypeError: terminated (ZstdDecompress)
```
Or random crashes during large syncs.

**Diagnosis:** Node.js v25+ has known zstd decompression bugs.

**Fix — switch to LTS:**
```bash
nvm install 22 && nvm use 22
# or: brew install node@22; export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"
```

**If you can't switch:** v25 tends to crash on large syncs (millions of blocks). Recent-block tests (~100K) often work.

**Hyperliquid-specific:** v25 crashes are especially common during large fills syncs (50M+ blocks). Checkpoint/resume works reliably — let it crash and restart until sync completes.

**Prevention:** use Node.js 22 LTS at version 22.15.0 or later. Node 20 does not satisfy the current package engine.

## Error Pattern 10: Hyperliquid Validation — SDK vs Portal Block Batching

**Symptoms:** `validate.ts` Portal cross-reference shows wildly different fill counts vs ClickHouse, even though spot-checks pass and data looks correct.

**Diagnosis:** Pipes SDK batches Hyperliquid blocks differently from raw Portal queries. The SDK may merge, split, or reorder blocks internally — a Portal query for `fromBlock: X, toBlock: Y` may return a different count than what the SDK indexed for the same nominal range.

**This is NOT a bug.** Data is correct; counting methodology differs.

**Fix — use spot-checks as primary truth verification:**
```typescript
// DON'T rely on block-range count comparison
// ClickHouse: 15,234 vs Portal: 14,891 → misleading 2.3% diff

// DO use transaction-level spot-checks:
// 1. Pick 3–5 specific fills from ClickHouse (by hash or tid)
// 2. Query Portal for the same block
// 3. Verify field-level match: coin, px, sz, side, dir, user
```

Treat count comparisons as approximate sanity checks (20–30% tolerance) and spot-checks as authoritative.

## Error Pattern 10b: Hyperliquid addFillRequest Missing Range

**Symptoms:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'from')
    at parsePortalRange
    at HyperliquidFillsQueryBuilder.addRequest
    at HyperliquidFillsQueryBuilder.addFillRequest
```

**Diagnosis:** `addFillRequest()` requires a `range` parameter. Unlike EVM decoders where range is set once, each Hyperliquid fill filter needs its own range.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// WRONG
.addFillRequest({ request: { coin: ['BTC'] } })

// CORRECT
.addFillRequest({ range: { from: 920000000 }, request: { coin: ['BTC'] } })
```

Dataset starts at block **750,000,000**. In SDK 1.0+, use `hyperliquidFillsQuery()` instead of `new HyperliquidFillsQueryBuilder()`.

## Error Pattern 11: Renamed SDK Exports After Reinstall

**Symptoms:** a previously working project fails after a fresh `npm install` / lockfile regeneration:
```
TypeError: evmDecoder is not a function
SyntaxError: The requested module '@subsquid/pipes/evm' does not provide an export named 'evmPortalSource'
```

**Diagnosis:** the project pins the floating `"alpha"` dist-tag (the old alpha CLI's default), which resolves to `1.0.0-alpha.22` as of 2026-08-26. That version already carries the beta-line renames: `evmDecoder` → `evmEventDecoder`, the `evmPortalSource`/`solanaPortalSource`/`hyperliquidFillsPortalSource` aliases removed (only `*PortalStream` remain), `evmPortalMockStream` → `mockEvmPortalStream`, `batchForInsert`/`chunk` → `chunkForInsert`, and query methods such as `addLog` → `addLogRequest`. Confirm with:
```bash
npm ls @subsquid/pipes        # installed version
grep '"@subsquid/pipes"' package.json   # "alpha" = floating tag
```

**Fix (pick one):**
1. **Migrate (recommended):** rename the imports/calls to the current names (see [SDK_FEATURES.md](SDK_FEATURES.md#renamed-in-the-beta-line)) and pin `"@subsquid/pipes": "^1.0.0-beta.1"`.
2. **Freeze:** pin the exact version the code was written for, e.g. `"@subsquid/pipes": "1.0.0-alpha.16"`, and migrate later.

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always use Pipes CLI** — never manually create indexer files
2. **Verify environment first** — see [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)
3. **Start with recent blocks** — faster iteration, faster failures
4. **Check proxy status** before running — single biggest failure mode
5. **Use dedicated databases** — prevents sync table conflicts
