# Temporary EVM v2 Gateway Authentication

As of the May 19, 2026 12:00 UTC cutover, authenticated calls to the v2 gateway are mandatory for self-hosted setups. Migrating to Portal is the recommended path. The public Portal is shared capacity; authenticated and dedicated Portal endpoints accept `x-api-key` with the same paths and payloads.

Use this intermediate configuration only when the user explicitly wants to remain on an EVM v2 gateway that still exists. Eighteen datasets became Portal-only on 2026-08-05, 67 more retired from both v2 and Portal on 2026-08-20, and the remaining gateways are being sunset.

## Configure the key

1. Register at <https://portal.sqd.dev/app> and create a gateway API key.
2. Upgrade `@subsquid/evm-processor` to `1.30.0` or later on the v2 line:

```bash
npm i @subsquid/evm-processor@^1.30.0
```

3. Convert the gateway call:

```diff
- .setGateway('https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/<slug>')
+ .setGateway({
+   url: 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/<slug>',
+   apiKey: process.env.SQD_API_KEY,
+ })
```

4. Keep the credential untracked:

```bash
echo 'SQD_API_KEY=...' >> .env
echo 'SQD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' >> .env.example
echo '.env' >> .gitignore
```

`GatewaySettings.apiKey` defaults to `SQD_API_KEY`, but passing it explicitly makes the dependency visible. Older processor versions reject the field with `TS2353: 'apiKey' does not exist in type 'GatewaySettings'`.

Going to `latest` instead skips this intermediate configuration: the current EVM stack uses `@subsquid/evm-stream` / `@subsquid/evm-objects`, where `setGateway` is gone. Pin the v2 version only when remaining on v2 is deliberate.
